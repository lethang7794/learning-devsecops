# Chap 3. Integrating Security

In DevSecOps,

- security is an integral element contained within each step of the software development lifecycle.

- the processes & tools for security are available to all members of a DevSecOps team (rather than only of the security team)

## Integrating Security Practices

- Some processes & tools that should exists regardless of DevSecOps

  - Patch, update process
  - Thread modeling; identification of attack vector, model
  - Security training
  - Compliance for legal/regulation requirements
  - Disaster recovery (DR) policies, responses, recovery

- Some processes & tools for DevSecOps

  - Least privilege
  - Role-based authentication
  - Key-based, certificate-based authentication
  - Code traceability

### Implementing Least Privilege

Everyone should have only enough - no more, no less - permissions to handle their tasks.

e.g.

- Granting the minimum rights needed for database users
  - Read records
  - Create new record
- Some software requires elevated permissions to be installed, but day-to-day work doesn't need these permissions

> [!WARNING]
> Least privilege can be frustrating at times, because of the context switching required when a developer finds that they can‚Äôt access certain data.

#### File permissions in Linux

File permissions in Linux is the answer to

- 1Ô∏è‚É£ **who**?
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ can **do what**?

In Linux:

- Every file has 6 _permission modes_ (aka _file mode_) (üëà 2Ô∏è‚É£ do what?)

  - 3 normal modes: `read`, `write`, and `executable`

    | Permission | File                                                           | Directory                                                                                              |
    | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | Read       | Read the **content** of the file.                              | Read the **names** of files in the directory.                                                          |
    | Write      | _Modify & delete_ the file.                                    | _Create, rename & delete_ files in the directory.                                                      |
    | Execute    | Execute the file (if the user also has read permissions on it) | Access file information in the directory:<br />- change into it (`cd`)<br />- list its content (`ls`). |

  - 3 special modes: the `sticky bit`, `setuid`, and `setgid`.

- Every file has 3 types of _class_ (ownership category): `user`, `group`, and `other`. (üëà 1Ô∏è‚É£ who?)

  The _class_ of a file specifies the ownership category of users who may have different permissions to perform any of the above operations on a file.

  | File class | The ownership category of users                      | Notes       |
  | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
  | User       | The user that own the file                           | aka `owner` |
  | Group      | The group that own the file, has one or more members |             |
  | Other      | The category for everyone else                       | aka `world` |

When files are created, they are usually given:

- the `owner`: the current user
- the `group`: group of the directory the file is in

  But this varies with the operating system, the file system the file is created on, and the way the file is created.

You can change the

- owner and group of a file by using the `chown` and `chgrp` commands.
- permissions of a file by using the `chmod` command.

> [!NOTE]
> When using `chmod`, the permissions can be specified in symbolic notation or octal notation
>
> | Permission (üëà 2Ô∏è‚É£ do what?) | Symbolic notation | Octal notation |
> | --------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------- |
> | Read                        | `r`               | `4`            |
> | Write                       | `w`               | `2`            |
> | Execute                     | `x`               | `1`            |

##### File permissions in action

- e.g.

  ```bash
  $ ls -la /etc/hosts
  -rw-r--r--. 1 root root 538 Mar  2 15:13 /etc/hosts
  ```

- A `file permission bits` - e.g. `-rw-r--r--.` - specify
  - the scope of permissions (üëà 2Ô∏è‚É£ who?)
  - the type of access (üëà 1Ô∏è‚É£ do what?)

|         | Prefix              | `File permission bits` (aka `file mode bits`)   | Suffix                          |
| ------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Example | `-`                 | `rw-r--r--`                                     | `.`                             |
|         |                     | `rw-` `r--` `r--`                               |                                 |
| Purpose | File type           | Each `permission bit` is represent:             | Additional permission features  |
|         | - `-`: regular file | - In _symbolic_ notation by **3 characters**.   | - `.`: SELinux context          |
|         | - `d`: directory    | - or in _octal_ notation by **a octal number**. | - `+`: ACL                      |
|         | - ...               |                                                 | - `@`: extended file attributes |

##### Symbolic notation

| The                                             | 1st triad | 2nd triad | 3rd triad |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| ... is the permission bit for file class of ... | `user`    | `group`   | `other`   |
| Example                                         | `rw-`     | `r--`     | `r--`     |

In symbolic natation, each `permission bit` is present by 3 characters:

- First character represent `read` permission: `r` if reading is permitted, `-` if it is not.
- Second character represent `write` permission: `w` if writing is permitted, `-` if it is not.
- Third character represent `execute` permission : `x` if execution is permitted, `-` if it is not.

##### Numeric notation (aka octal notation)

In numeric notation, the `file mode bits` is represent by 4 octal digits (`0-7`), derived by adding up the bits with values `4`, `2`, and `1`

| Example                | File mode bits      | First digit                                      | Second digit | Third digit     | Fourth digit    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------ | --------------- | --------------- |
|                        | Bit values          | `4`: set-_user_-ID bit                           | `4`: read    | The same values | The same values |
|                        |                     | `2`: set-_group_-ID bit                          | `2`: write   |                 |                 |
|                        |                     | `1`: restricted deletion or _sticky_ attributes. | `1`: execute |                 |                 |
|                        |                     |                                                  |              |                 |                 |
| Anyone can do anything | Numeric: `777`      |                                                  | `7`          | `7`             | `7`             |
|                        | Symbol: `rwxrwxrwx` |                                                  | `rwx`        | `rwx`           | `rwx`           |
|                        |                     |                                                  |              |                 |                 |
|                        | Numeric: `755`      |                                                  | `7`          | `5`             | `5`             |
|                        | Symbol: `rwxr-xr-x` |                                                  | `rwx`        | `r-x`           | `r-x`           |
|                        |                     |                                                  |              |                 |                 |
|                        | Numeric: `644`      |                                                  | `6`          | `4`             | `4`             |
|                        | Symbol: `rw-r--r--` |                                                  | `rwx`        | `r--`           | `r--`           |

##### Using `chmod` to change file permission modes

The `chmod` command supports both type of permission notation:

- For symbolic notation, `chmod` can add/remove/set permissions of each individual file class (or all file classes).
- For numeric notation, `chmod` can set permissions of:
  - all file classes
  - some trailing classes (by ignoring leading digits)

#### Role-based access control (RBAC)

RBAC
: granting permissions based on the **role** (or job duties).
: ~ group-based permissions (no more granting permissions to individuals)
: no more revoking all permissions of someone leaving

e.g.

- A hiring manager can access to data about candidates, salaries... of someone hired into a developer role.
- A developer
  - doesn't need to (& can't) access to these data.
  - need to access to the development server...

### Security for authentication process

- Don't you a permanent credential, e.g. password

  - use a short-term or/and revokable credential, e.g. token

- If you must use a password:

  - Don't use the same password for many accounts.
  - Don't remember the password by heart, use a password manager - e.g. `1Password`, `Bitwarden` - try your best to secure it.
  - Instead of using only password:
    - Use multi-factor authentication:
      - OTP from an app, a physical key.
    - Use Passkey

- When using SSH protocol to connect to a remote server:
  - Instead of using SSH key-pair
    You can
    - Prevent someone from using your SSH key-pair (A public-private key-pair can be protected with a username/password)
    - Prevent a host - that has the SSH key-pair - e.g. your computer - from connecting to a remote host, e.g. instead of your server, it's the attacker server
  - Use short-live certificate that's signed by a Certificate Authority (CA).

## Maintaining Confidentiality

### Data in Flight

#### HTTPS, DoH

- Instead of using HTTP (HTTP over TCP/IP) - and sending unencrypted data (as plaintext).

  - Using HTTPS (HTTP over **TLS** over TCP/IP) that has an extra TLS connection to _encrypt_ the data (using _asymmetric cryptography_).

> [!NOTE]
> No mailing post-card, only mailing letter.

> [!NOTE]
> HTTPS is like using Enigma machine to encipher your messages. Even if someone opens it, they still cannot read the real messages.

- Using DNS over HTTPS (DoH) (from a centralized DNS resolvers, e.g. Google, CloudFlare, instead of from ISPs) to protect privacy.

> [!NOTE]
> No one should know you're surfing `Reddit`, `Facebook`, some `NSFW` pages, whether it's your boss, the IT guys, or the Big Brother.

#### Eavesdropping on email

For email,

- To transfer email (between servers), there is SMTP - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
- To receive email (on end-user devices), there are

  - POP3 - Post Office Protocol v3
  - IMAP - Internet Message Access Protocol

- These protocols are all un-encrypted - just like HTTP - but can integrated with TLS to add encryption.

#### Transfer files

- Secure Shell (SSH) is encrypted by default.
- File Transfer Protocol (FTP) needs to add the encryption layer.

#### Wired versus WiFi versus offline

Data traverses a wired network is less likely to eavesdropping than a wireless network (Wifi, Cellular/LTE).

An attacker can capture the traffic over wireless network (Physical layer), but they still need to break the layer on top (TLS) to decrypt the HTTP traffic.

### Data at Rest

After transferred through the network, data will be at rest - in a storage, e.g. disks, USB drives, backup tapes...

Data at rest needs to be

- encrypted at:

  - Hardware level
  - OS level
  - Database level
  - File level

- using standard ciphers, e.g. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

> [!CAUTION]
> Remember, these standard ciphers still can be brute-force attack with enough computing resource and time.
>
> - Time-sensitive data is not a big problem if attackers success.
> - But long-lived data - Social Security, medical record,... - may cause problematic.

### Data in Use

Data in use needs to be protect by best-effort of patching CVEs and preventing supply-chain attacks.

## Verifying Integrity

An attack on integrity may take a long time before found.

- To verify integrity, in additional to the data, there need to be a verifiable source of original truth.
- If an attacker can approach the source of original truth, they can change the data integrity without being notice.

### Checksums

hash function
: a function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values (hashed string)
: ~ _checksum function_, e.g `MD5`, `SHA-1`,`SHA-256`, `SHA-384`, `SHA-512`

checksum ~ one-way hashed
: take a _data_, e.g. a file/string; execute a _checksum function_ on it will return a _checksum_

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A checksum:
>
> - is unchanged for a specific dagta
> - has a fixed length no matter the size (this length is depended on the algorithm of the hash function)

> [!TIP]
> Fingerprint -> A Person
> Hashes string -> File/String

> [!WARNING]
> A matched checksum doesn't guarantee 100% that the file/string hasn't been corrupt/altered.
>
> - There may be collisions.

### Verifying Email

[SDP] - **Sender** Policy Framework ~ (IP check)
: Ensures the **sending mail server** is authorized to originate mail from the email sender's domain
: ~ Is the mail's sender matched with the sender server?
: e.g.
: - A mail that claims it's from `example.com`, needs to be sent from `1.2.3.4` IP address

> [!TIP]
> A mail that claims it's from `you`, needs to be sent from `your home's address`.
>
> The collect postman check if the mail's sender address matched the house address?

[DKIM] - **DomainKeys** Identified Mail ~ (Domain check)
: Allows the **receiver** to _check_ that an email that claimed to have come from a specific domain was indeed authorized by the owner of that domain
: ~ Is the mail sealed & has the sender signature?
: e.g.
: - A mail that claims it's from `example.com` needs to have a public key for `example.com`

> [!TIP]
> A mail that claims it's from `you` needs to be _sealed_ and has `your signature`
>
> The deliver postman check if the mail's has its sender signature?

[DMARC] [^DMARC] - Domain-based Message Authentication, **Reporting**, and Conformance
: Give email **domain owners** the ability to protect their domain from unauthorized use (email spoofing)

> [!TIP]
> Someone is sending fake mails in your name, what do want to do with those mails?

> [!CAUTION]
> All 3 protocols: SPF, DKIM, and DMARC rely on DNS to function.
>
> If your DNS infrastructure is exploit, attackers can:
>
> - Add IP to SPF
> - Change the signature to their
> - Change the policy of DMARC

## Providing Availability

To increase availability, the single points of failure needs to be eliminated.

With the advent of cloud computing, the cost of providing availability in computing has decreased:

- Deployments in multi-cloud providers, in multi-regions is achievable.

### Service-Level Agreement (SLA) and Service-Level Objectives (SLOs)

SLA - Service-Level Agreement
: PROMISE: The agreement you make to your clients, end users
: External
: e.g.
: - How much downtime is acceptable during a period (a month/quarter/year)?
: - Monthly Uptime Percentage of no less least 99.9%

SLOs - Service-Level Objectives
: GOAL: The objectives your team must hit to meet that agreement
: Internal
: e.g.
: - Each services must a lot less than SLA - 99.99%, 99.999%

SLIs - Service-Level Indicator
: MEASURE: The real indicator about the performance
: External & Internal
: e.g.
: - Customer looks to SLI to demand a refund.

### Defining SLA

#### Identifying Stakeholders

stakeholders
: who paid for the app:
: - so the app can be developed: have direct influence on the decisions about the app & it's availability
: - so they can use it: need to be represented by user groups, internal customer services

#### Identifying Availability Needs

The availability needs can be

- provided:

  - directly by the stakeholders
  - indirectly via interviews/meetings

- gathered through observation (more accurate)

> [!NOTE]
> Regardless of the method, you should verify back with the logs (traffic/request logs).

> [!CAUTION]
> The seasonal and cyclical activities should be included when identifying availability needs.
>
> e.g. A monthly report run at the end of a month/quarter may be missed by everyone.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> But what exactly availability means?
>
> - Which level?
>   - Network: IP
>   - Transport: TCP
>   - Application: HTTP
> - How long is latency?

How do you know that the system has that availability? Monitoring, observation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Evaluation criteria of a monitoring software:
>
> - Protocols
> - Complexity of the check
> - Alerting
> - Scaling
> - ...

#### Estimating Costs

The cost for availability may increase exponentially.

| The level of availability | % uptime | Downtime per year |        |       | Downtime per day |       |       |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ----------------- | ------ | ----- | ---------------- | ----- | ----- |
|                           |          | (day)             | (hour) | (min) | (hour)           | (min) | (sec) |
| One 9                     | 90%      | 36.5 day          |        |       | 2.4h             |       |       |
| Two 9s                    | 99%      | 3.65 day          |        |       |                  | 14m   |       |
| Three 9s                  | 99.9%    | 0.365 day         | ~ 9h   |       |                  | 1.4m  |       |
| Four 9s                   | 99.99%   |                   | ~ 1h   | 55m   |                  |       | 9s    |
| Five 9s                   | 99.999%  |                   |        | 5.5m  |                  |       | 0.9s  |
| Six 9s                    | 99.9999% |                   |        | 0.5m  |                  |       | 0.09s |

## What About Accountability?

accountability
: _Who_ did _what_ & _when_ did they do it?

In computing, these info are available via logging.

For Linux, logging is handled by:

- `syslog`: old system, easy to use but hard to scale.
- `systemd`: new system, plain-text at `/var/log`.

> [!NOTE]
> There are a lot of things needs to be done with log:
>
> - Monitor the logs in realtime
> - Import log entries to a database
> - Automatically archive old logs

### Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)

The main goal of SRE is providing visibility & transparent throughout the SDLC,

This is done by:

- Monitoring
- Logging, log analysis

> [!CAUTION]
> Monitoring & logging can
>
> - decreased performance of the system.
> - increase cost:
>   - doing monitor
>   - store the logging

To balance the cost and the amount of logs, you can:

- Use feature flag to indicate the level of log
- Ensure the applications, services supports
  - changing its functions depends on the feature flag without restarting/re-initializing.
  - monitoring automatically when deployed (e.g. Using Ansible)

> [!NOTE]
> With feature flag, an CI/CD system can quickly enable/disable features of the applications.

> [!NOTE]
> How much monitoring should we have?
>
> As much as we can get:
>
> - It still depends on the type of services, the longevity of each nodes.
> - But more metrics is better than not enough metrics.

### Code Traceability and Static Analysis

#### Code Traceability

code traceability (Programming)
: tracing a line of code backward through the source code management history to the original change request that caused the developer to write it

code traceability (Testing)
: step through the code line by line, watching in-memory data as it changes

code traceability (DevSecOps)
: step through the code to validate & verify its operation:
: - use build-time flags & feature flags to add more debugging instrumentation & logging
: - e.g. A microservice is slow

#### Static analysis and code review

static analysis (static program analysis)
: analysis of computer programs performed without executing them
: e.g. linter, CVEs scanner...

dynamic program analysis
: analysis of computer programs performed by executing them
: e.g. function testing, code coverage, fuzzing, concurrency errors, performance analysis...

code review
: review process to adherence to the coding style & quality standard of an organization

Static analysis and code review can identify these kind of issues:

- Errors & bugs (unexpected behaviors)

- Maintaining issues

  e.g. Ternary may be prohibited

- Security issues

  e.g. The code run as expected, but a user can see other users's resources.

- CVEs

- Compliance & Regulation issues

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Static analysis tools can be integrated at:
>
> - Local environment:

#### Compliance & regulatory issues

Any organization needs to act in compliance with the regulation.

> [!CAUTION]
> False positives: a test result incorrectly indicates the presence of a condition.
>
> Static analysis can have false positives, which can cause a lot of overhead.

## Becoming Security Aware

Computer security problems can be traced back to 2 major reason:

- Lack of awareness (from developers, operations...)
- Lac of time imposed by often-**_artificial_ deadlines**.

### Finding Formal Training

Security training is available at many forms:

- On-site
- Virtual
- Classroom
- Hand-ons

Ideally, an organization can have training that is customized to the organization needs & its technology (programming languages, infrastructures...)

There are also generalized training & certificates from

- [SANS Institute](https://www.sans.org/about/)
- [ISC2](https://www.isc2.org/):
  - [Certificates](https://www.isc2.org/certifications)
    - CC ‚Äì Certified in Cybersecurity - an entry level certificate
    - CISSP - Certified Information Systems Security Professional - is the gold standard for security certifications

### Obtaining Free Knowledge

- [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/): a standard awareness document for developers and web application security
- [OWASP Cheat Sheet Series](https://owasp.org/www-project-cheat-sheets/): simple good practice guides for application developers that the majority of developers will actually be able to implement.

#### Input valid

Developers who integrate security into the development process assume that all input/external data

- is incorrect, e.g. empty data, too long...
- may have been entered with malicious intent

All data needs to be valid:

- on the client but still give good UX.
- on the server

### Enlightenment Through Log Analysis

Servers are under attack all the times, there are bot attacks that scan for:

- Open ports
- CVEs
- Default password

By examining log files, you can get enlightenment about the type of attacks.

## Practical Implementation: ZAP

### Why ZAP?

Zed Attack Proxy (`ZAP`) is cross-platform software used for vulnerability scanning of web applications.

> [!TIP]
> Zed Attack Proxy `ZAP` (its website is [zaproxy.org](https://www.zaproxy.org)) is originally an project from OWASP, but has [join](https://www.zaproxy.org/blog/2023-08-01-zap-is-joining-the-software-security-project/) Software Security Project (SSP) - an initiative of the Linux Foundation.

ZAP provides a graphical interface and trivially easy method to scan for common problems highlighted on the OWASP website.

Additional functionality is freely available from a variety of add-ons in the [ZAP Marketplace](https://www.zaproxy.org/addons/), accessible from within the ZAP client.

### What is ZAP?

At its core, ZAP is what is known as a `man-in-the-middle proxy`.

ZAP:

- stands between the tester‚Äôs browser and the web application
- will:
  - intercept, inspect messages sent between browser and web application
  - modify the contents if needed
  - forward those packets on to the destination.

See:

- [ZAP - Getting Started](https://www.zaproxy.org/getting-started/)

### Who can use ZAP?

ZAP provides functionality for a range of skill levels ‚Äì from developers, to testers new to security testing, to security testing specialists.

### Where ZAP can run?

ZAP supports

- Major OS: Linux, Windows, Mac
- Docker
- CI: GitHub Actions

See <https://www.zaproxy.org/download/>

### ZAP in action

> [!WARNING]
> A scan by ZAP can be interpreted as an attack.
>
> You should
>
> - scan only targets that you have permission to test.
> - also check with your hosting company and any other services such as CDNs that may be affected before running a ZAP scan.

#### Creating a Target

We'll use OWASP [Juice Shop](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop) - a demo web app encompasses vulnerabilities from the entire OWASP Top Ten along with many other security flaws found in real-world applications!

> [!CAUTION]
> Don't use someone public web application as a target of your ZAP test, you may go to jail.

Juice Shop can runs

- on a variety of platforms: including Node.js, Docker, and Vagrant,
- or as an instance on Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Azure, or Google Compute Engine

> [!TIP]
> A ruining instance of the latest version of OWASP Juice Shop is available at: <http://demo.owasp-juice.shop>

> [!WARNING]
> The demo instance is a deployment-test and sneak-peek instance only!
> You are not supposed to use this instance for your own hacking endeavors! No guaranteed uptime! Guaranteed stern looks if you break it!

#### Installing ZAP

#### Getting Started with ZAP

##### ZAP Mode

- `Safe`: no potentially dangerous operations permitted.
- `Protected`: (Default) you can only perform (potentially) dangerous actions on URLs in the scope.
- `Standard`: does not restrict anything.
- `ATTACK`: new nodes that are in scope are actively scanned as soon as they are discovered.

See <https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/desktop/start/features/modes/>

##### Manual Scan

##### Automation Scan

## Summary

- Integrate security throughout DevOps to create DevSecOps.
- CIA triad and security.
- Zed Attack Proxy (ZAD).
